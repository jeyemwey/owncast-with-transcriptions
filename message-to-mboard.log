Hey y'all, sorry for bringing this thread back up, but I have a similar issue.

Our livestreams are usually longer than five minutes and we dont want to interrupt the process and possibly lose transcribed text. In my testing with the en-UK model and a typical audio sample, the last `is_final` result is upto 40 seconds before the 300s mark, and thus we would have lost 40 seconds of transcription.

I have seen the Endless Streaming tutorials page, but there is no tutorial for Go which our software is based on. From what I understand from the other languages, the code is similar to the Audio Stream sample code, but it has a `while true:` loop that resets the stream setting. Can anyone confirm if this is true?

Thanks,
Jannik
